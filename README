CMCKAY emacs config

So I don't know how to use emacs, and by default its so far behind my vim setup
that its simply unusable. After some (alot) of searching I found a pretty good
perl setup by genehack (https://github.com/genehack/emacs) that I'm more or less
copying. Trouble is its got so much stuff in it and does so much that I have no
idea where what comes from, so I'm stealing it part by part and rebuilding it
from the ground up. Accompanying doco for each part is going into my private
wiki for the moment. Maybe I'll move it later if I find somewhere else that
might be useful.

Installing

Just check it out as .emacs.d in ~, can set it up as a link thing if we really
want, but don't really care enough. This works fine so far
